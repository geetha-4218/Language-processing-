Here's a basic Python source code example for a project titled:
"Exposing Truth with Advanced Fake News Detection Powered by Natural Language Processing"

This example uses NLP techniques with scikit-learn and TfidfVectorizer to classify news as fake or real using a logistic regression model.

Requirements:

Install dependencies first:

pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy

Python Source Code:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

# Load dataset (you can replace this with your own CSV file)
# Dataset should have columns: 'text' and 'label' (where label is 1 for real, 0 for fake)
df = pd.read_csv("news_dataset.csv")

# Preprocessing
X = df['text']
y = df['label']

# Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Vectorization
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_df=0.7)
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Model training
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

# Prediction and Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Sample Prediction
def predict_news(news_text):
    vec = vectorizer.transform([news_text])
    result = model.predict(vec)
    return "Real News" if result[0] == 1 else "Fake News"

# Test it
sample_news = "The government has confirmed that all citizens will receive free healthcare."
print("Sample Prediction:", predict_news(sample_news))

Notes:

Replace "news_dataset.csv" with your dataset path.

You can expand this with deep learning (e.g., LSTM or BERT) for better performance.


Would you like a version using deep learning (TensorFlow or PyTorch)?
